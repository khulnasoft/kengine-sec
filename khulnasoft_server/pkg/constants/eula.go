Trial/Evaluation Licenses will terminate automatically on the expiration date if not renewed pursuant to the terms of the License as further defined in Section 6 (Duration) above.

KHULNASOFT shall have the right without further obligation or liability to Licensee to terminate this Software License Agreement and Licensee's license hereunder as to any KHULNASOFT Program.

The following obligations shall survive termination of the Software License Agreement for any reason: (i) Licensee's obligations under Sections 9 (Non-Disclosure); and (ii) Paragraph (3) of this Section. Termination of this Software License Agreement will not relieve either

Upon the termination of this Software License Agreement as to any KHULNASOFT Program, the license and all other rights granted to Licensee as to that KHULNASOFT Program hereunder shall immediately cease, and Licensee shall immediately:

return that KHULNASOFT Program to KHULNASOFT including all documentation, manuals and copies in respect of that KHULNASOFT Program;

purge all copies of that KHULNASOFT Program and any portions thereof from all CPU's and storage media and devices on which Licensee has placed or allowed others to place that KHULNASOFT Program; and

upon request provide KHULNASOFT with written certification that Licensee has complied with its obligations under this Paragraph 12(3).

13. General Provisions

Licensee shall not have the right to assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations under this Software License Agreement except with the written consent of the other party.

This License will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents. This License shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of this License shall continue in full force and effect.

This Software License Agreement supersedes all proposals, oral or written, and all negotiations, conversations or discussions heretofore had between the parties related to this Software License Agreement. Licensee acknowledges that it has not been induced to enter into this Software License Agreement by any representations or statements, oral or written, not expressly contained herein. The terms and conditions of this Software License Agreement shall prevail, notwithstanding any variance with the terms and conditions of any order or other instrument submitted by Licensee.

This Software License Agreement supersedes any and all other Software License Agreements between the parties governing KHULNASOFT Programs.

This Software License Agreement shall not be deemed or construed to be modified, amended, rescinded, cancelled or waived, in whole or in part, except by written amendment signed by the parties hereto.

The obligations of Licensee under Sections 4 (Restrictions on Use) and 9 (Non-Disclosure) hereof are of a special and unique character which gives them a peculiar value to KHULNASOFT for which KHULNASOFT cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages in the event Licensee breaches such obligations. Therefore KHULNASOFT shall, in addition to other remedies which may be available, be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief in the event of the breach or threatened breach of such obligations.

14. Taxes and Duties

Licensee shall be responsible for taxes levied on any transaction under this Software License Agreement, including but not limited to all federal, state, and local taxes, levies and assessments, excluding any tax based on KHULNASOFT’s income.

15. Notices

Any demand, notice, consent, or other communication required by this Agreement must be given in writing and shall be deemed delivered upon receipt when delivered personally or upon confirmation of receipt following delivery by internationally recognized overnight courier service to the addresses specified on the applicable ordering document (Product Schedule, quote or purchase order).

16. Export Controls

Licensee acknowledges that this Software is subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (the "EAR") and Licensee will comply with the EAR. Licensee shall not export or re-export this Software, directly or indirectly, to: (1) any countries that are subject to US export restrictions; (2) any end user who Licensee knows or has reason to know will utilize them in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or rocket systems, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets, or unmanned air vehicle systems; or (3) any end user who has been prohibited from participating in the US export transactions by any federal agency of the US government. In addition, Licensee is responsible for complying with any applicable local laws regarding export or use of this Software.

17. Entire Agreement

This Agreement is the complete statement of the understanding between the parties, and supersedes all prior proposals and other communications between the parties. Performance of any obligation required by a party hereunder may be waived only by a written waiver signed by an authorized representative of the other party. Failure or delay by either party in exercising any right or remedy will not constitute a waiver. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid, the entire Agreement shall not fail on its account, and that provision shall be severed, with the balance of this Agreement continuing in full force and effect. The terms and conditions contained in any purchase order issued by Licensee shall be of no force or effect, even if the order is accepted by KHULNASOFT. This Agreement shall supersede all terms of any unsigned, shrink-wrap or clickwrap license included in any package, media or electronic version of the software and any such software shall be licensed under the terms of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict in terms among the Agreement and a Product Schedule, the Product Schedule shall control. Licensee is an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between KHULNASOFT and Licensee. Certain Software contains product security measures which may include password protection, anti-copying subroutines or other security measures designed to restrict the installation and/or usage of the Software to the licensed configuration.
